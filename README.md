# Memory_Matcher

// I want to create a memory matching game. It will feature a 3x2 grid. The player will have to rely on their memory to match two tiles. Once all tiles are matched, the player wins! But, here's the catch, there's a 1 minute timer!


Tiles will be randomly sorted at the beginning of every game.
Any matched tiles will stay facing up.
Tiles that do not match will face down after every round.
Once all pairs are matched or the timer ends, the game is over. If the timer ends before all matches can be made, you lose. If all matches are made before the game ends, you win!
There will be a one minute timer. You can try to beat your previous time after every game.
Good luck and have fun!
