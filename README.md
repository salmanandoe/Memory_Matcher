# Memory_Matcher

I have created a memory matching game. It features a 3x2 grid. The player will have to rely on their memory to match two cards. Any matched cards will stay facing up.
Cards that do not match will face down after every round.
Once all pairs are matched, the game is over and the player wins!
Good luck and have fun!
